# Create a Cinematic LUT (.cube) Using ChatGPT

This guide explains how you can create a color grading LUT (Look-Up Table) file using ChatGPT, inspired by a color palette (e.g., from a film like *Oppenheimer*).

## What You Need

- Access to [ChatGPT Plus](https://chat.openai.com) with code and image capabilities
- An image or reference of the color palette you want to use
- A clear idea of the cinematic look you're aiming for

---

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Upload Your Palette Image
Upload an image showing the color palette you'd like to use (e.g., a color scheme from a movie or photo). Make sure the colors are clear and visually distinct.

### Step 2: Ask ChatGPT to Extract Colors
Ask something like:
> "Extract the color codes from this image and create a LUT (.cube file) based on these tones."

ChatGPT will analyze the image and identify the main colors in it (usually in hex format like `#424c4d`).

### Step 3: Generate the LUT
ChatGPT will:
- Normalize the colors
- Blend them subtly into a 3D LUT space
- Write the LUT to a `.cube` file
- Give you a download link to the file

### Step 4: Import Into Video Editor
Download the `.cube` file and import it into your video editing software (e.g., CapCut, DaVinci Resolve, Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro).

## Example Result

In this repo, you'll find:
- `Oppenheimer_Look.cube`: LUT file inspired by *Oppenheimer*'s muted, vintage palette

---

## Notes

- You can adjust the intensity of the LUT by modifying the blending factor (ask ChatGPT to tweak it).
- You can generate `.3dl` or other formats if neededâ€”just ask!
